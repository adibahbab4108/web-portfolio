            <p>For me, programming fascinated me in the aspect of all the programs and applications you can make with it. After researching different programming languages I really got into HTML and CSS.I first started to learn programming for finding out of curiosity. Then I started an online store with Shopify and realized that having a solid understanding of front end development really helped to customize my store and make it much, much better. After that, I started to develop a passion for helping small businesses grow and I wanted to do this by amplifying their online presence. The best way for me to do this, or at least to start, is by building websites for small businesses in my area to really help them grow.</p>
